__Task description__

Given two positive integers __m__ and __n__, generate a multiplication matrix of the shape __m__ x __n__. The output should be a list of __m__ lists, each of the size __n__, containing the product of every number from 1 to __m__ with every number from 1 to __n__ in row-major order.

_Note_: Your solution must occupy one line of code by using a list comprehension.
