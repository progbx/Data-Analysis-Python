# Data Analysis Course

## Development environment

You have to install the required dependencies using either `pip` or `conda`. See the commands below.

### Pip installation

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

### Conda installation

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate data-analysis-course
```

## Jupyter

Throughout the course you will use both an IDE of your choice to edit Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks. Some IDEs support Jupyter Notebooks natively (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.), but it is also possible to start a Jupyter server explicitly and work with notebooks via your browser.

### Start Jupyter Server

Run the following command in the terminal:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
A new window should pop up in your browser.

### VS Code

Please refer to the following [tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks) in case you use `VCCode` as your IDE.

### PyCharm

Please refer to the following [tutorial](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/jupyter-notebook-support.html#tool-windows) in case you use `PyCharm` as your IDE.
