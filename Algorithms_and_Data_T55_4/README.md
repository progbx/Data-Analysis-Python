__Task description__

Implement a generator for an infinite sequence of Pell numbers that satisfy the following rule: The first two numbers are 0 and 1, respectively, and each subsequent number is the sum of double the preceding number and the number that precedes the preceding number.

_Note_: Your generator will then be tested by running it one, two, ..., 10 times.
